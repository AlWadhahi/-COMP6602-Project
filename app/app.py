the purpose of this project is to build a classifier that
is able to classify car images into two labels:

- Damage: For cars that were damaged in accident as an example
- Non-damage: For cars that are clean and without visible damage

#### [Checkout the code in the repo here](https://github.com/AlWadhahi/COMP6602-Project)

and feel free to try out the project by uploading an image of a car ðŸ‘‡""")
